<li>We will create a market in which you will act as bidder in a sequence of auctions. There
are three identical units up for sale in which you and one other bidder are competing to
win. You and your rival both demand two of these three identical units.</li>

<li>Each bidder will be assigned valuations for the two identical units they demand. These
valuations represent the value of the good to you if you obtain it, i.e., what we will pay you
for any items purchased. The values of each of the two units will be different from each
other. If won, the first unit will provide you with a valuation denoted by: (<em>v1</em>). If both
units are won, your valuation from earning only one of the units will be increased by (<em>v2</em>).
You can think of (<em>v2</em>) as the incremental value you get for winning a second unit above
your initial value for the first unit won. Your valuations are known only to you and are
completely independent of the valuations assigned to your competitors. Your valuations
will be drawn anew before each auction.</li>

<li>The incremental value for the second unit (<em>v2</em>) will be randomly drawn from an interval
where the lowest possible value is $0 and the highest possible value is $10.00. This is the
same for all bidders. Any value within this interval has an equally likely chance of being
drawn and being assigned as your valuation. Values for the first unit (<em>v1</em>) will be drawn
from an interval where the lowest possible value is equal to the incremental valuation drawn
for winning the second unit and the highest possible value is $10.00. Any value within this
interval has an equally likely chance of being drawn and being assigned as your valuation.
Note that it is possible, but unlikely, that you will have the same valuation(s) as one or
more of your competitors.</li>

<li>Each bidder submits two bids (bids must be greater than or equal to zero) - one for each
unit corresponding to the valuations they were given.</li>

<li>After you and your competitors have submitted your bids, the auctioneer will rank them
from highest to lowest. The three highest bids will each be awarded one unit and the losing
bid (the fourth highest bid) will set the “clearing price” that all winning bidders will have
1to pay on each of the units they won. This is called a uniform price auction - everyone
pays the same price regardless of your bid.</li>

<li>The auctions you will play in have been designed to guarantee that you will win at least
one unit and that the bid you submit on your highest valued unit will never set the clearing
price. In other words, you are guaranteed to always win at least one of the two units you
demand and that you will never have to pay your highest bid.</li>

<li>The experiment will consist of numerous rounds, taking approximately 45 minutes in total.
An auction with two bidders will take place in each round. You are one bidder, the second
bidder is chosen randomly for each round. So you are bidding against one other person in
each round who may or may not be the same person from the previous round.</li>

<li>Each bidder submits two bids (bids must be greater than or equal to zero) - one for each
unit corresponding to the valuations they were given.</li>
