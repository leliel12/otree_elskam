<li>In case of a tie - for example the 3rd and 4th highest bid are the same - the computer will randomly determine which of the two bids is the second highest and earns an item and which of the two bids does not earn an item.</li>
<li>You are free to bid whatever you think will bring you the most earnings. However, for programming purposes we have restricted all bids to be greater than or equal to zero in addition to the bids for the second unit to be less than or equal to the bid on the first unit listed.</li>
<li>Your starting balance of $5 does not restrict how much you can bid. Recall that your value is what you will get for any items earned, so that you do not have to &rdquo;secure&rdquo; your bid with your cash balance. The latter is just designed to provide you with some minimum earnings and a fund from which any negative earnings will be subtracted.</li>
<li>Your final payoff will be determined by only one of the 25 auctions you will play. More specifically, one of the 25 auction rounds will be chosen at random and your profits (losses) earned from that auction will be added (subtracted) to your starting balance of $5 to determine your final balance. All final balances will be paid to you in cash at the end of the experiment.</li>
<li>To ensure that you never lose money, you may consider restricting your bids to never exceed your valuation. However, if in any case your final balance falls below $0, you will not be asked to pay the balance owing.</li>
<li>We will conduct 2 dry runs to familiarize you with the procedures and accounting rules. This will be followed by 25 periods played for cash.</li>
<li>Please feel free to ask questions as we go along. You are not permitted to talk to each other until the experiment is over.</li>
