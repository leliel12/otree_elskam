I have attached four different files to give you an idea of the experiment I
have in mind.  The Treatments_Final file outlines the 4 different treatments
and the timing of the experiment. Part 1_Instructions file outlines the
questionnaire that all subjects will answer on-line before they play the
auction game.  Part 2_ UNIF_T1  file  outlines the particular instructions
for Treatment 1.  Because I am using between subject design, I will create a
separate instruction document for each of the four treatments as I will have
illustrative examples in each document that are specific to the treatment.
(I have only provided you with one of these instruction documents for now.)

Please let me know what I can provide you with next. I also included a short
description of the uniform and discriminatory price auction formats as well as
two citations for each.

Also, let me know what I need to do on my end to set up the payoneer transfer.
